## Evidence

Since my [last evaluation submission](./0002-2024-05-evidence.md), I have focused on advancing Encointer's democracy 
experiments while also contributing to the maintenance of the Encointer runtime. A highlight of my work is [PR#456](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/456) 
which introduces one-person-one-vote (1p1v) experiments on the Encointer Network. This is a pioneering initiative 
within the Polkadot ecosystem and holds potential for influencing alternative governance models, such as sub-treasury 
management or petition systems on Kusama and Polkadot. Iâ€™m eager to see how this will unfold.

While this achievement was a team effort, my role centered on providing conceptual leadership and specification. 
I led the implementation of key features, enabling communities to allocate treasury funds using 1p1v democracy and 
to support petitions. Additionally, I developed testing environments using agent-based e2e simulations on a local testnet 
to validate the new democratic processes.

Beyond my contributions to Encointer, I remained an active member of the community. I spoke at Decoded 2024 and 
participated in the in-person fellowship meeting in Brussels.

## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [ ] Concern(s): 

- [X] Comment(s):
  - I do not take a salary from Encointer Association. Therefore, no treasury grants that went to Encointer went into my efforts listed above. 
  - I'm de-facto code owner of a systemchain (Encointer) since way before its first block. My dedication to Encointer and its runtime will be unaffected by whatever rank the fellowship grants me.
